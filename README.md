## Why MediLinkUp

MediLinkUp  is a centralized eHealth system to collect patient medical records  that will facilitate detection and classification of disease  cases to assist medical professionals in decision making for treatment 
or patient care.

## Technical stack

OVH for hosting

####    COVID 
"Co": "corona","vi": "virus"  "D":  " disease"

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

On 31 December 2019, WHO was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) was identified as the causative virus by Chinese authorities on 7 January. As part of WHO’s response to the outbreak, the R&D Blueprint has been activated to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus.

Since the start of the outbreak the World Health Organization (WHO) has been supporting African governments with early detection by providing thousands of COVID-19 testing kits to countries, training dozens of health workers and strengthening surveillance in communities. Forty-seven countries in the WHO African region can now test for COVID-19. At the start of the outbreak only two could do so.

** World data visiliazation 
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ and https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/ reported
1,676,820 coronavirus cases, 101,557deaths and 372,253 Recovered.  

The economy is low and people suffered and economies in Sub-Saharan Africa could lose between $37 billion and $79 billion in output losses in 2020 due to COVID-19 (coronavirus), according to a new World Bank regional economic analysis. The region could face a severe food security crisis, with agricultural production expected to contract between 2.6% and 7%. 

African countries urgently need to take on a customized short-term policy approach that takes into consideration the structural features of the region: (1) the size of informal employment in the region accounting for 89% of total employment; (2) the precariousness of most SSA jobs, (3) the predominance of small and medium-sized enterprises which constitute 90% of business units and are the drivers of growth in the region, and (4) the ineffectiveness of monetary stimulus due to the reduced labor supply and closed businesses, and in the recovery phase due to weak monetary transmission in countries with underdeveloped financial markets.

We believe, as a team composed of developers and researcher on IT, product design, data scientist and biotech, doctors that we can make contributions from our aspects to help the people to curb the pandemic situation.

Our hope of this project is to develop a prototype for selecting patients via deep learning. 
Later, we want to apply forfundings, e.g. fast-grant 

[https://fastgrants.org/,  for improving the project.  Ultimately, we hope to develop a software and data platform that will be widely used by ordinarly people around the Africa , as an
accurate, cost-effective, and easy-to-use solution that can accurately diagnose the COVID-19 virus and complement doctors' diagonsis and testing.

We plan to:

1. Build a website to collect data of patient's symptoms
2. Create a large database epidemiology data and identify coronavirus symptoms. 
3. Manage the datebase, making it usable to other researchers while
   taking care of privacy concerns.
4. Build a IA method  to learn from the data and detect early covid-19 symptoms.  The learned model
   allows us to make a diagnose.
5. Evaulaute IA method

* Team (on-going)

Our team needs
Data scientist 
Epidemiologist
doctor or a public health official

We also need expertise from a mentor. Our concern might be how to get
the initial data

Currently, we have:

* Problems to solve

** Website and data collection patient and doctors 

We need to show a preliminary website and argue for the design
choices. Two things are the most important above all.
-  the kind of data we need to collect
-  how we take care of privacy concerns

** Data
We need to consider 
- how the data should be stored. E.g. place of storage and format
- Data selection 

** Deep Learning
We need to consider
- What we can do at the very beginning as few data are available.

### Data science and epidemiology
Good datascientists know that domain expertise is critical for building good models. So, before you publicize another COVID-19 forecasting model, please ask yourself the following questions:

1. Do I have any domain experience in epidemiology or biostatistics?
2. If you answered 'no' to the above, did you review your model with someone having these skills?
3. If you answered 'no' to #1 and #2, can you find someone with these skills?

Finally, if you answered 'no' to all of the above, please add a caveat to your write-up. Something like: "This model needs to be reviewed by someone with domain experience, but I found..."
