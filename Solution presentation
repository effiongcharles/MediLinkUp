##  Answer these : 
      How does your solution fix the problem ?
      
      Our solution of this project is to develop a prototype for classification and selection the severity  
            patients via machine learning algorithms. 
      
      What are the key features ? 
      
     *** Build a website to collect data of patient's symptoms
     
     
     *** Create a large database containing patients history.

     *** Manage the datebase, making it usable to other doctors and heath personal  while taking care of privacy concerns.

     *** Build a IA method to learn from the data and detect early covid-19 symptoms.
         The learned model allows us to make a diagnose.
      *** Evaulaute IA method with opinions  of doctors
